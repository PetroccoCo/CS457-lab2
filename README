SS and AWGET
================
NOTE: Professor Wakefield agreed that we can exclude the multi-threading capability for our project because of the participation troubles we've faced.  Everything else should be fully functional. 

BUGS:
SS fails to remove hosts from the chainfile if they do not match the host's hostname ie using localhost instead of a hostname
URLs plus wget commands total 255 chars - this starts getting really short as to combat downloading google.com and getting index.html urls are saved to their url ie google.com to google.com
  This means urls can be a max of around 122 chars right now.

Tested on 4 hosts in the CS department. Complilation yeilds a lot of warnings most of which are not of any real concern.
