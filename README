SS and AWGET
================
NOTE: Professor Wakefield agreed that we can exclude the multi-threading capability for our project because of the participation troubles we've faced.  Everything else should be fully functional. 

BUGS:
SS fails to remove hosts from the chainfile if they do not match the host's hostname ie using localhost instead of a hostname
